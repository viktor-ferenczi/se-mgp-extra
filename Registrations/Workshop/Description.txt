[h1]Multigrid Projector Extra[/h1]

Extra functionality and convenience features for the [b]vanilla[/b] projector block.

[h2]Sorry, confusing mod name[/h2]

This mod does [b]not[/b] allow loading/welding blueprints with multiple subgrids in itself. It is the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415983416]Multigrid Projector[/url] plugin which allows for that. Unfortunately I named this mod in a pretty confusing way, sorry.

This mod is to add a few extra functionality over the Multigrid Projector plugin. The functionality detailed below work both with and without the plugin.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*] Projector control panel button to load a self-repair projection for the projector's own mechanical group (ship)
[*] Intuitive manual alignment of the projection with familiar character and block movement
[/list]

Please [b]see the videos[/b] on how the above features work.

[h2]Remarks[/h2]
[list]
[*] Upon loading the self-repair projection "Keep projection" is automatically enabled.
[*] This is [b]not[/b] a "mod version" of the Multigrid Projector!
[*] Despite its name this mod also works with the vanilla game.
[*] It is a regular mod which needs to be added to the world as usual.
[*] Currently there is no way to re-bind the alignment controls. - Please send me a PR (see GitHub below) if you fix this!
