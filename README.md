# Multigrid Projector Extra

[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2497985921)

Extra functionality and convenience features for the **vanilla** projector block.

## Features
* [Intuitive manual alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRhkO07nUUE) of the projection with familiar character and block movement
* Projector control panel button to [load a self-repair projection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yufwA0hiMX8) for the projector's own mechanical group (ship)

## Remarks
* Upon loading the self-repair projection "Keep projection" is automatically enabled.
* This is **not** a "mod version" of the Multigrid Projector!
* Despite its name this mod also works with the vanilla game.
* It is a regular mod which needs to be added to the world as usual.

## Sorry, confusing mod name

This mod does **not** allow loading/welding blueprints with multiple subgrids in itself.
It is the [Multigrid Projector](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/multigrid-projector/) client
plugin which allows for that. Unfortunately I named this mod in a pretty confusing way, sorry.

This mod is to add a few extra functionality over the Multigrid Projector plugin.
The functionality detailed below work both with and without the plugin.
